		<p>Hello! My name is Tim and I am a junior Data Scientist, former professional musician with 15+ years of experience, and a United States Marine Corps veteran. I love playing jazz (specifically bebop), classic rock, blues, and heavy metal. My favorite programming languages include Python, SQL, R, and using Microsoft Excel.</p>
		<p>I discoverd my passoion for programming when I needed a way to practice my musical scales in an unbias way. So, when I discoverd that there were no such apps in the App Store, I learned how to code an iOS app using Swift that would randomly generate a scale for me to play. The rest, as they say, is history!</p>
